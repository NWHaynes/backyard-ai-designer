1. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
   - Overall style/theme (modern, traditional, rustic, contemporary, farmhouse, etc.)
   - Existing features (furniture, plants, structures, materials, surfaces)
   - Size assessment (small urban, medium suburban, large estate, etc.)
   - Current condition (pristine, well-maintained, needs work, neglected, etc.)
   - Layout characteristics (open, sectioned, formal, casual, etc.)

2. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS (3-5 suggestions):
   - What would work best in THIS specific space
   - Consider the existing architecture and style
   - Factor in the yard size and layout
   - Suggest realistic improvements that complement existing elements

3. STYLE PROFILE:
   - What design style would complement this space
   - Color palette that would work well
   - Materials that would fit the aesthetic
   - Architectural elements to preserve or enhance

4. IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES:
   - Most impactful changes for this yard
   - Budget-friendly quick wins
   - Long-term transformation ideas

5. GENERATION CONTEXT (CRITICAL FOR AI IMAGE GENERATION):
   Provide a detailed 3-4 sentence description specifically for AI image generation that includes:
   - Exact architectural style and current aesthetic
   - Specific materials, surfaces, and features to preserve
   - The type of improvements that would enhance (not clash with) this style
   - Guidance for maintaining the space's unique character and proportions

Example Generation Context:
"Contemporary suburban backyard featuring clean concrete surfaces, established mature evergreen trees, and sleek modern furniture with geometric lines. The space exhibits strong minimalist bones with high-quality hardscaping that should be preserved. Improvements should enhance the sophisticated modern aesthetic through selective organic elements rather than overwhelming the clean design. Any additions must complement the existing scale and maintain the refined contemporary character."
